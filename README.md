# gridSolver

A python3 program that computes words from a 4x4 grid of letters.

The word must be 3 letters or longer and found in the nltk words library.

To see instructions on downloading nltk, see here:

Uncomment out # nltk.download('words') on the first run.

To change the letters, modify the grid array to contain the desired board.

This program simply prints all of the words out.

The solutions.txt file contains the discovered words that the program found.
